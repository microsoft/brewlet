# Layered classpath deployment

The class-path runtime supports `entry.classPath`,
`classpath.layer.v1+tar` layers, and unpacking dependencies to `/app/lib`. This
page explains how Brewlet ships an application as **several OCI layers split
along dependency-stability boundaries** instead of one opaque fat JAR.

It is the class-path counterpart to [JPMS support](jpms-support.md), which covers
the same layering idea for the **module path** (`-p`).

---

## 1. TL;DR

- **A fat JAR is one opaque blob.** Every rebuild — even a one-line change to your own
  code — produces a brand-new archive with a brand-new digest, so the **whole thing**
  is re-pushed and re-pulled. The 200 MB of dependencies that did not change are
  shipped again anyway.
- **Brewlet already ships JARs as OCI layers**, so it can borrow the well-known
  "layered JAR" trick (Spring Boot `layers.idx`, Jib, Cloud Native Buildpacks, Docker
  layer caching): put the **stable dependencies** in their own layer(s) and the
  **volatile application classes** in another. Registries and the containerd content
  store then dedup the heavy dependency layers across versions *and* across apps by
  digest — only the small app layer moves on a typical rebuild.
- **Brewlet uses a classpath layer for dependencies.**
  [SPECIFICATION §4.1](https://github.com/microsoft/brewlet/blob/main/specs/SPECIFICATION.md#41-media-types) and
  [reference](reference.md#oci-media-types) already list
  `application/vnd.brewlet.classpath.layer.v1+tar` as an *optional* layer "for
  classpath mode": a tar of JARs unpacked to `/app/lib`, driven
  by the existing `entry.mode: "classpath"` plus an optional `entry.classPath`.
- **This is additive and fully backward compatible.** A single fat JAR
  (`entry.mode: jar`) stays the default and the recommended path for most teams. Layer
  splitting is an opt-in optimization for large or frequently-rebuilt services.
- **Per-application `jlink`/`jmod` payloads remain out of scope.** Layering is
  about how application class files are packed, independent of the full JDK or
  shared jlink runtime selected from node inventory.

## 2. Background: the fat-JAR blob problem

### 2.1 What Brewlet ships today

Today a Brewlet artifact carries exactly **one** payload layer — the raw
self-executable JAR (`application/vnd.brewlet.jar.layer.v1+jar`,
`core/internal/artifact/artifact.go`). `Store.Push` writes a single `jarDesc` into
`Manifest.Layers`:

```go
m := Manifest{
    // …
    Layers: []Descriptor{jarDesc},   // one layer, the whole fat JAR
}
```

A fat JAR (Spring Boot `bootJar`, Maven Shade, Gradle Shadow) inlines the application
**and every dependency** into that one archive. Because the layer digest is the SHA-256
of the whole archive, changing a single application class changes the digest of the
entire dependency payload too.

### 2.2 Why that hurts at scale

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| **Full re-push every build** | One layer, one digest — no sub-part can be deduped. A 5 KB code change re-uploads 150–250 MB. |
| **Full re-pull on the node** | The containerd content store dedups by layer digest; a new fat-JAR digest is a cache miss, so the shim fetches the whole thing again. |
| **No cross-app sharing** | Two services on the same Spring Boot BOM still store their dependencies twice — the bytes are identical but buried in different fat-JAR digests. |
| **Slow cold pulls** | Startup latency ([§13](https://github.com/microsoft/brewlet/blob/main/specs/SPECIFICATION.md)) includes pulling the artifact; a smaller changed-layer pull is a faster cold start. |

### 2.3 Prior art: layered JARs

The container ecosystem solved this years ago by **splitting along change frequency**:

- **Spring Boot layered jars** write a `layers.idx` that groups content into
  `dependencies`, `spring-boot-loader`, `snapshot-dependencies`, and `application`,
  precisely so a Docker build caches the first three and rebuilds only the last.
- **Jib** and **Cloud Native Buildpacks** do the same automatically: a dependencies
  layer, a resources layer, and a classes layer.
- **Docker/OCI layer caching** then dedups every unchanged layer by digest.

Brewlet artifacts are *already OCI layers*. Adopting the same split gives the same
dedup for free — without a Dockerfile.

---

## 3. Alignment with the Brewlet model

Brewlet's thesis: ship only the developer's bytecode; the JDK installation lives on the node,
shared and patched centrally (see the [project landing page](/) and
[concepts](concepts.md)). Layered classpath deployment fits cleanly:

- **Still only bytecode.** The layers contain JARs — application classes and library
  JARs — and nothing else. No OS, no JVM. The node JDK still does the launching.
- **Same mount, same isolation.** Layers are unpacked into the same read-only `/app`
  tree the shim already assembles ([§6.1](https://github.com/microsoft/brewlet/blob/main/specs/SPECIFICATION.md#61-per-container-lifecycle-create)).
  Nothing about the runc sandbox, cgroup mapping, RuntimeClass, or admission path
  changes.
- **Dedup is a registry/containerd property, not a runtime one.** Splitting into layers
  changes only *how the bytes are packed and addressed*, so the win is realized entirely
  by the registry and the node's content store — exactly the layers Brewlet already
  leans on.

**Conclusion:** Brewlet supports an **optional, ordered set of classpath layers**
that unpack to `/app/lib`, launched via the existing class-path entry mode. This is the
concrete design for the `classpath.layer.v1+tar` media type the spec already names.

## 4. Capability matrix

| Capability | Without layering | With layering | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fat JAR (`java -jar`) | ✅ | ✅ | `entry.mode: jar` (default, unchanged). |
| Class-path main, single JAR (`java -cp app.jar Main`) | ✅ | ✅ | `entry.mode: classpath` (unchanged). |
| **Thin app JAR + dependency layer(s)** (`java -cp app.jar:lib/* Main`) | ❌ | ✅ | New: optional classpath layer(s) → `/app/lib` (§5–§6). |
| **Multiple ordered layers** (deps / snapshot-deps / app) | ❌ | ✅ | Each tar is its own OCI layer; dedup per layer (§7). |
| Cross-app dependency dedup | ❌ | ✅ | Identical dependency layer digest is stored once. |
| Explicit classpath ordering | ❌ | ✅ | `entry.classPath` array (§5). |
| Module path layering (`-p /app/mods`) | ❌ | ✅ | Covered by the [JPMS note](jpms-support.md); parallel mechanism (§8). |
| Shared `NodeProfile` jlink runtime | N/A | N/A | Supported independently as node inventory. |
| Per-application `jlink` runtime | ❌ | ❌ (by design) | Duplicates the JVM in the artifact. |
| `jmod` packaging | ❌ | ❌ (by design) | Build-time only. |

## 5. Launch config: `entry.classPath`

The launch config ([SPECIFICATION §4.2](https://github.com/microsoft/brewlet/blob/main/specs/SPECIFICATION.md#42-launch-config-config-blob-schema)
/ [reference](reference.md#launch-config-schema-config-blob)) supports an optional
`entry.classPath` for `classpath` mode. Existing `jar` and `classpath` configs
can omit it.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "mainJar": "app.jar",
  "entry": {
    "mode": "classpath",              // "jar" | "classpath" | "module"
    "mainClass": "com.acme.orders.Main",
    "classPath": ["app.jar", "lib/*"] // optional; ordered, resolved under /app
  }
}
```

Resolution rules:

| Config | Emitted command |
|---|---|
| `mode: classpath`, no `classPath` | `java -cp /app/app.jar com.acme.orders.Main` *(today)* |
| `mode: classpath`, `classPath: ["app.jar","lib/*"]` | `java -cp /app/app.jar:/app/lib/* com.acme.orders.Main` |
| `mode: classpath`, `classPath: ["app.jar","lib/a.jar","lib/b.jar"]` | `java -cp /app/app.jar:/app/lib/a.jar:/app/lib/b.jar com.acme.orders.Main` |

- Each entry is resolved relative to `/app`; entries are joined with the platform path
  separator (`:` on Linux nodes) **in the order given** (class-path order is
  significant).
- `lib/*` uses the JVM's built-in class-path wildcard, which expands to every `*.jar`
  in `/app/lib` (non-recursive) — the same convention Spring Boot's `PropertiesLauncher`
  and ordinary `java -cp 'lib/*'` use. This keeps the config stable even as the exact
  set of dependency JARs changes.
- When `classPath` is omitted, `classpath` mode falls back to today's single-`mainJar`
  behavior.

The launch core change is confined to the `classpath` case of the existing
`switch cfg.Entry.Mode` in `BuildJVMArgs` (`core/internal/runtime/launch.go`):

```go
case "classpath":
    if cfg.Entry.MainClass == "" {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("entry.mode=classpath but entry.mainClass is empty")
    }
    cp := jarPath                                   // default: just the main jar
    if len(cfg.Entry.ClassPath) > 0 {
        cp = resolveClassPath(cfg.Entry.ClassPath)  // join under /app in order
    }
    args = append(args, "-cp", cp, cfg.Entry.MainClass)
```

No shim isolation, provisioner, RuntimeClass, operator, or resource→JVM mapping change
is required — this is an **argv-and-artifact-layout** concern, the layer Brewlet already
owns.

---

## 6. Artifact format: ordered classpath layers

### 6.1 Layer media type

Give the reserved media type its meaning: an
`application/vnd.brewlet.classpath.layer.v1+tar` layer is a **tar of JAR files** that
the shim unpacks under `/app/lib`. An artifact may carry **zero or more** such layers,
in manifest order.

```go
// /core/internal/artifact/artifact.go
const ClasspathLayerMediaType = "application/vnd.brewlet.classpath.layer.v1+tar"
```

`Store.Push` gains an optional list of classpath-layer tars appended to
`Manifest.Layers` after the main JAR layer, each written as its own blob (its own
digest → its own dedup unit). The thin application JAR keeps the existing
`jar.layer.v1+jar` type so `Manifest.JarLayer()` still resolves the entry point.

### 6.2 Mounting & launch

```
/app/app.jar            # thin application JAR  (jar.layer.v1+jar)  — changes every build
/app/lib/               # dependency JARs        (classpath.layer.v1+tar layers)
  ├── spring-core-6.1.10.jar
  ├── jackson-databind-2.17.1.jar
  └── … (rarely change)
```

```bash
java -cp /app/app.jar:/app/lib/* com.acme.orders.Main
```

During [rootfs assembly](https://github.com/microsoft/brewlet/blob/main/specs/SPECIFICATION.md#61-per-container-lifecycle-create),
the shim mounts the JAR layer at `/app` and unpacks each
`classpath.layer.v1+tar` into `/app/lib` (read-only, shared like the JAR). Everything
else — overlayfs, cgroups, CNI, signals — is unchanged.

### 6.3 Layer split strategy

Mirror Spring Boot's `layers.idx` ordering, **stable → volatile**, so a change high in
the stack invalidates as few layers as possible:

| Layer (tar) | Typical contents | Change frequency |
|---|---|---|
| `deps` | released third-party dependencies | rarely (dependency bumps) |
| `snapshot-deps` | `-SNAPSHOT` / internal libs | occasionally |
| `app` *(the `jar.layer`)* | your compiled classes + resources | every build |

Because each tar is a separate OCI layer with its own digest, a build that only touches
application code re-pushes **only the `app` JAR layer**; the `deps` layers are already
present in the registry and the node content store.

---

## 7. Cache & dedup behavior

What actually moves over the wire on a rebuild:

| You change… | Layers with a new digest | Re-pushed / re-pulled |
|---|---|---|
| Only your own classes | `app` (jar layer) | just the small app JAR |
| Bump one released dependency | `deps` + `app` | dependency layer + app JAR |
| Bump an internal `-SNAPSHOT` | `snapshot-deps` + `app` | snapshot layer + app JAR |
| Nothing (re-tag) | none | nothing — full dedup |

Two services built on the same dependency set produce the **same `deps` layer digest**,
so the registry and every node store it once. This is the identical property that makes
Docker base-image layers cheap — Brewlet gets it without a base image.

> **Determinism caveat.** The dedup win depends on **reproducible layer tars**: stable
> file ordering and zeroed/pinned timestamps inside the tar, so unchanged inputs yield
> an identical digest. The layer builder (CLI / Maven plugin) must normalize tar
> entries — the same discipline Jib and reproducible-build Maven plugins already apply.

---

## 8. Relationship to the JPMS `mods` layer

This note and the [JPMS note](jpms-support.md) describe **the same layering mechanism
pointed at two different launch surfaces**:

| | Class path (this note) | Module path (JPMS note) |
|---|---|---|
| Layer media type | `…classpath.layer.v1+tar` (spec-reserved) | `…modulepath.layer.v1+tar` (defined in JPMS §6.1) |
| Unpack dir | `/app/lib` | `/app/mods` |
| Entry mode | `classpath` + `entry.classPath` + `entry.mainClass` | `module` + `entry.modulePath` + `entry.module` |
| Launch flag | `-cp /app/app.jar:/app/lib/*` | `-p /app/mods:/app/app.jar` |
| Applies to | non-modular / mixed apps (the common case) | JPMS modular apps |

Brewlet uses the same tar-of-JARs mechanism for both, parameterized by target
directory and whether the resulting directory feeds `-cp` or `-p`.

### 8.1 Mixed class path + module path

A modular (JPMS) app frequently needs **both** a module path (`-p`) and a
supplementary class path (`-cp`) — e.g. a JPMS application that also depends on
automatic-module or non-modular libraries that are cleanest to carry on the class
path. Brewlet supports this **mixed form** by keeping `entry.mode: module` and
additionally permitting `entry.classPath`:

```jsonc
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "mainJar": "orders.jar",
  "entry": {
    "mode": "module",
    "module": "com.acme.orders",
    "modulePath": ["orders.jar", "mods"],   // -> /app/orders.jar:/app/mods  (-p)
    "classPath": ["lib/*"]                    // -> /app/lib/*                (-cp)
  }
}
```

The launcher emits the supplementary class path **before** the module path so the
terminal `-m <module>` (after which everything is a program argument) stays last:

```
java -cp /app/lib/* -p /app/orders.jar:/app/mods -m com.acme.orders[/<mainClass>]
```

Both a `classpath.layer.v1+tar` layer (→ `/app/lib`) and a
`modulepath.layer.v1+tar` layer (→ `/app/mods`) may be shipped simultaneously.
With the CLI this is `brewlet push app.jar ref --classpath-layer deps.tar
--module-layer mods.tar` on a modular JAR (auto-detected `entry.classPath=["lib/*"]`),
or any config supplied via `--config`. This closes SPECIFICATION §16 Open
Question #3 for the mixed case.

---

## 9. Tooling implications

- **`brewlet` CLI (`push`).** `--classpath-layer TAR` (repeatable)
  attaches pre-built dependency tars as `classpath.layer.v1+tar` layers next to the
  thin `jar.layer`; `brewlet inspect` lists every layer with its media type and digest
  so dedup is visible. Parsing a framework layering manifest such as Spring Boot's
  `layers.idx` is a **non-goal** (see [§10 Non-goals](#10-non-goals)); the
  generic classes/deps split does not need it — see the [PetClinic interop
  walkthrough](spring-petclinic.md#layered-classpath-delivery).
- **Maven plugin.** Setting `<layered>true</layered>` (or
  `-Dbrewlet.layered=true`) for a plain thin JAR packs its resolved dependency tree
  (`project.getArtifacts()`, compile+runtime scope) into reproducible
  `classpath.layer.v1+tar` layers next to a thin app JAR, split `deps` /
  `snapshot-deps` (`brewlet.splitSnapshotLayers`, default on), and emits
  `entry.mode=classpath` with `entry.classPath=["<mainJar>","lib/*"]` and the derived
  `entry.mainClass` (`Start-Class`/`Main-Class` or `<mainClass>`). Works for both
  `brewlet:build` (local OCI layout) and `brewlet:push`. `JarInspector`
  (`brewlet-maven-plugin/.../util/JarInspector.java`) supplies the main class.
  Standard **Spring Boot executable JARs** instead have `BOOT-INF/classes/`
  relocated into a deterministic thin application JAR and their exact packaged
  `BOOT-INF/lib/*.jar` bytes copied into dependency layers. The generated explicit
  classpath follows `BOOT-INF/classpath.idx` (which must list every library once),
  or ZIP library order when no index exists. The source JAR is unchanged, and
  build/push/config/inspect/AppCDS all share the same prepared payload. Unsupported
  custom layouts and unsafe ZIP entries fail rather than silently producing an
  unlaunchable image; see the
  [plugin contract](https://github.com/microsoft/brewlet/blob/main/maven-plugin/README.md#layered-spring-boot-jars).
  For a **modular** project the same `<layered>true</layered>` flag instead packs
  the resolved runtime module dependencies into a single `modulepath.layer.v1+tar`
  layer (`/app/mods`) and emits `entry.mode=module` with
  `entry.modulePath=["<mainJar>","mods"]` — see [JPMS support](jpms-support.md).
  Dependency-layer grouping does not reinterpret a framework layering manifest;
  consuming Spring Boot `layers.idx` remains a non-goal. It is distinct from
  preserving the runtime classpath order in `classpath.idx`.
- **ORAS (manual).** The multi-layer form is a plain multi-layer OCI push:

  ```bash
  oras push registry.example.com/team/app:1.4.2 \
    --artifact-type application/vnd.brewlet.app.v1+json \
    --config   jvm-config.json:application/vnd.brewlet.jvm.config.v1+json \
    app.jar:application/vnd.brewlet.jar.layer.v1+jar \
    deps.tar:application/vnd.brewlet.classpath.layer.v1+tar \
    snapshot-deps.tar:application/vnd.brewlet.classpath.layer.v1+tar
  ```

- **Docs.** The "layered (thin JAR) apps" example lives in
  [building & publishing](building-and-publishing.md#layered-thin-jar-apps) and the
  `entry.mode` / media-type rows in [reference](reference.md).

---

## 10. Non-goals

- **Not a reproducible-build guarantee for your JARs.** Brewlet normalizes the *layer
  tar*; reproducibility of the JAR contents themselves is your build's responsibility.
- **No isolation, provisioner, RuntimeClass, or resource-mapping changes.** Layering is
  purely artifact layout + argv.
- **Per-application `jlink`/`jmod` payloads stay out of scope.** Shared
  `NodeProfile` jlink runtimes are independent of artifact layering; see the
  [JPMS note §2.2](jpms-support.md).
- **The fat JAR stays first-class.** Layering is opt-in; small or infrequently-rebuilt
  services should keep shipping a single `entry.mode: jar` artifact.
- **No framework-specific layering-manifest parsing.** Brewlet does **not** read Spring
  Boot's `layers.idx` (or any other framework's layering scheme) in the CLI or Maven
  plugin — supporting one would oblige it to support all. Brewlet's contract is the
  generic `classpath.layer.v1+tar` format; frameworks that emit layered output map onto
  it with generic, structural steps (see the
  [PetClinic interop walkthrough](spring-petclinic.md#layered-classpath-delivery)).
