# Configuration

Every knob Brewlet exposes, in one place: Helm chart values, node-provisioner
environment variables, operator/admission flags, the `RuntimeClass`, and how the
different layers relate. For *how* to install, see [Installation](installation.md);
for JDKs and launchers specifically, see [JDK management](jdk-management.md) and
[Launchers](launchers.md). For how the resulting node labels drive scheduling
and autoscaling, see
[Capability labels and autoscaling](capability-labels-and-autoscaling.md).
For the operational workflow behind the metrics values, see
[Runtime metrics and Grafana dashboards](runtime-metrics.md).

---

## Configuration layers (how they connect)

There is **one source of truth** for the JDK/launcher inventory: you set it once,
and it flows down.

```
Helm values (provisioner.jdks / .launchers)
        │  become operator flags
        ▼
Operator flags (--jdks / --launchers)
        │  flow into the DaemonSet container env
        ▼
Provisioner env (JDKS / LAUNCHERS)
        │  drive what gets installed on each node
        ▼
Node state: /opt/brewlet/jdks/<dist>-<feature>/ + capability labels/annotations
```

If you use Helm, set values. If you run the operator directly, set flags. If you
hand-wire the DaemonSet, set env vars. Don't mix — the operator overwrites the
DaemonSet it manages.

> **Note on defaults.** The "Default" columns below are per-layer: they apply only
> when that layer is invoked directly. The Helm chart ships richer defaults than the
> bare binaries (e.g. `provisioner.jdks=temurin-21,microsoft-25` and
> `provisioner.launchers=jaz`), and passes them down explicitly, so a direct
> operator/DaemonSet invocation without those flags/env falls back to the leaner
> binary defaults (`--jdks=temurin-21`, `--launchers`/`LAUNCHERS` empty).

## Helm chart values

From [`charts/brewlet/values.yaml`](https://github.com/microsoft/brewlet/blob/main/kubernetes/charts/brewlet/values.yaml). Override
with `--set key=value` or a values file.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `namespace` | `brewlet` | Namespace all components install into (created by the chart). |
| `images.registry` | `ghcr.io/microsoft` | Registry prefix used to generate component image references. |
| `images.tag` | chart `appVersion` | Shared component tag. A versioned OCI chart therefore selects matching images automatically. |
| `images.operator` | generated | Explicit operator image override; supports tags or digests. |
| `images.provisioner` | generated | Explicit provisioner image override; supports tags or digests. |
| `images.admission` | generated | Explicit admission webhook image override; supports tags or digests. |
| `images.pullPolicy` | `IfNotPresent` | Image pull policy for all components. |
| `provisioner.jdks` | `temurin-21,microsoft-25` | Comma-separated curated `<dist>-<feature>` roots, or a structured list with `source.image` and `source.javaHome` for custom distributions ([§JDK management](jdk-management.md#custom-distributions-azul-zulu-example)). |
| `provisioner.launchers` | `jaz` | Comma-separated launcher layers ([§Launchers](launchers.md)). Empty = vanilla `java` only. |
| `provisioner.rollout.maxUnavailable` | `null` | Bounds the default profile's provisioner DaemonSet rolling update. `null` keeps the DaemonSet default. |
| `provisioner.rollout.validate` | `true` | Gate node readiness on post-install JDK and launcher smoke tests (`java -version` per root plus a deterministic version probe per launcher layer). Renders the provisioner `BREWLET_VALIDATE` env. |
| `provisioner.rollout.containerdRestart` | `validated` | Select containerd activation: transactional config validation, service restart, live health checks, and rollback (`validated`); legacy in-place render plus SIGHUP (`sighup`); or no containerd mutation/signal (`none`). Renders `BREWLET_CONTAINERD_RESTART` ([§5.5](https://github.com/microsoft/brewlet/blob/main/specs/SPECIFICATION.md)). |
| `provisioner.registry.mirrors` | `{}` | `<upstream-host>: <mirror-host>` map applied to every copy-from-image pull for air-gapped clusters. Renders `MIRRORS`. |
| `defaultProfile.enabled` | `true` | Render the chart-managed **default** `NodeProfile` from `provisioner.*`. Disable to manage the default profile yourself, e.g. via GitOps ([§5.6](https://github.com/microsoft/brewlet/blob/main/specs/SPECIFICATION.md)). |
| `profiles` | `[]` | Additional per-pool `NodeProfile` CRs, each binding node pool(s) to their own JDK/launcher inventory plus rollout/registry policy ([§5.6](https://github.com/microsoft/brewlet/blob/main/specs/SPECIFICATION.md)). |
| `operator.replicas` | `1` | Operator replica count. |
| `operator.leaderElect` | `true` | Enable leader election for HA. |
| `operator.resources` | requests `50m/64Mi`, limits `200m/128Mi` | Operator pod resources. |
| `metrics.enabled` | `false` | Opt in to Brewlet runtime and control-plane Prometheus endpoints. Enables the operator and admission listeners plus the node exporter sidecar and Services. |
| `metrics.nodePort` | `9090` | Port exposed by each node-local metrics exporter and the `brewlet-node-metrics` headless Service. |
| `metrics.serviceMonitor.enabled` | `false` | Create a Prometheus Operator `ServiceMonitor`. Requires the `monitoring.coreos.com/v1` CRDs. |
| `metrics.serviceMonitor.interval` | `30s` | Scrape interval rendered into the optional `ServiceMonitor`. |
| `metrics.serviceMonitor.additionalLabels` | `{}` | Extra `ServiceMonitor` labels, commonly used to match a Prometheus `serviceMonitorSelector`. |
| `metrics.grafanaDashboard.enabled` | `false` | Create the `brewlet-grafana-dashboard` ConfigMap for dashboard sidecar discovery; does not install Grafana or a data source. |
| `metrics.grafanaDashboard.labels` | `grafana_dashboard: "1"` | Labels applied to the dashboard ConfigMap for sidecar discovery. |
| `admission.enabled` | `true` | Deploy the admission/scheduling webhook. Set `false` to skip it; the shim still enforces runtime image identity and JDK compatibility. |
| `admission.replicas` | `1` | Webhook replica count. |
| `admission.failurePolicy` | `Ignore` | Webhook failure policy. `Ignore` keeps availability high, but runtime identity resolution still fails closed in the shim if containerd metadata cannot be resolved. |
| `admission.port` | `9443` | Webhook server port. |
| `admission.resources` | requests `50m/64Mi`, limits `200m/128Mi` | Webhook pod resources. |

Example production install (own registry, no `jaz`):

```bash
helm install brewlet oci://ghcr.io/microsoft/charts/brewlet \
  --version 0.3.1 \
  --set images.operator=registry.example.com/brewlet/operator@sha256:… \
  --set images.provisioner=registry.example.com/brewlet/node-provisioner@sha256:… \
  --set images.admission=registry.example.com/brewlet/admission@sha256:… \
  --set provisioner.jdks="temurin-21,temurin-25" \
  --set provisioner.launchers=""
```

> JDKs and launchers are always obtained **copy-from-image** (the vendor's
> official image, pulled through the host containerd). Mirror those images into
> your own registry for air-gapped clusters.

---

## Operator flags

The source for these flags lives in
[`cmd/manager`](https://github.com/microsoft/brewlet/tree/main/kubernetes/cmd/manager).
When you install via Helm, the chart populates them for you.

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--namespace` | `brewlet` | Namespace the provisioner DaemonSet is managed in. |
| `--provisioner-image` | `ghcr.io/microsoft/brewlet-node-provisioner:0.3.1` | Image the DaemonSet runs. |
| `--jdks` | `temurin-21` | Comma-separated `<dist>-<feature>` inventory (flows to the provisioner `JDKS` env). |
| `--launchers` | *(empty)* | Comma-separated launcher inventory (`LAUNCHERS` env). |
| `--leader-elect` | `false` | Enable leader election for HA. |
| `--metrics-bind-address` | `:8080` | Metrics endpoint. |
| `--health-probe-bind-address` | `:8081` | Health/readiness endpoint. |

```bash
./bin/operator --namespace=brewlet \
  --provisioner-image=ghcr.io/microsoft/brewlet-node-provisioner:0.3.1 \
  --jdks=temurin-21,microsoft-25 --launchers=jaz
```

---

## Node-provisioner environment variables

The provisioner environment contract lives in the core runtime's
[`provisioner/README.md`](https://github.com/microsoft/brewlet/blob/main/provisioner/README.md).
The Kubernetes operator sets these variables on the DaemonSet it manages; you
only touch them directly if you hand-wire the DaemonSet.

| Env var | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `JDKS` | `temurin-21` | Comma-separated `<distribution>-<feature>` roots to install. |
| `JDK_CUSTOM_SOURCE_COUNT` | `0` | Number of indexed custom source entries rendered by the operator. |
| `JDK_CUSTOM_SOURCE_<n>_{TOKEN,IMAGE,JAVA_HOME}` | *(empty)* | Internal operator-to-provisioner transport for custom `NodeProfile` JDK sources. Configure `spec.jdks[].source`, not these variables directly. |
| `LAUNCHERS` | *(empty)* | Comma-separated launcher layers to stage (e.g. `jaz`). `java` is implicit. |
| `NODE_NAME` | (downward API) | The node to label; injected from `spec.nodeName`. |
| `BREWLET_PREFIX` | `/opt/brewlet` | Host install prefix (`bin/`, `jdks/`, `launchers/`). |
| `CONTAINERD_CONFIG` | `/etc/containerd/config.toml` | Primary containerd configuration. Validated mode uses an imported drop-in when supported and otherwise patches this file with a backup. |
| `CONTAINERD_DROPIN_DIR` | `/etc/containerd/config.toml.d` | Drop-in directory used when the primary config imports `*.toml` from it. |
| `CONTAINERD_DROPIN_FILE` | `/etc/containerd/config.toml.d/99-brewlet.toml` | Brewlet-managed runtime drop-in. |
| `CONTAINERD_ADDRESS` | `/run/containerd/containerd.sock` | Host containerd socket (used for copy-from-image). |
| `CONTAINERD_NAMESPACE` | `k8s.io` | containerd namespace for image pulls. |
| `BREWLET_MODE` | `provision` | `provision` installs the runtime; `cleanup` reverses it (removes the Brewlet drop-in or restores the primary-config backup, removes the shim, and drops runtime/capability labels) for a deleted `NodeProfile`. The operator sets it on the short-lived `brewlet-cleanup-<profile>` DaemonSet (§5.6). |
| `BREWLET_CONTAINERD_RESTART` | `validated` | `validated` smoke-tests the runtime inventory, validates the effective config with `containerd config dump`, restarts the host service only when needed, checks containerd and the live `brewlet` handler, and restores known-good config on activation failure. `sighup` preserves the legacy in-place render/reload path without the config-dump gate. `none` neither mutates nor signals containerd. Rendered from `spec.rollout.containerdRestart`. |
| `BREWLET_VALIDATE` | `true` | Run post-install smoke tests for every JDK (`java -version`) and configured launcher before publishing runtime or capability labels. `false` skips both sets of probes. Rendered from `spec.rollout.validate`. |
| `MIRRORS` | *(empty)* | Comma-separated `<upstream-host>=<mirror-host>` pairs; every copy-from-image pull rewrites its registry host through this map for air-gapped clusters. Rendered from `spec.registry.mirrors`. |

---

## Admission webhook

The [`brewlet-admission`](https://github.com/microsoft/brewlet/tree/main/kubernetes/cmd/admission/) webhook is
mutating+validating. For every pod on CREATE with `runtimeClassName: brewlet` it:

- **overwrites** `brewlet.sh/artifact-ref` (and `brewlet.sh/artifact-digest` when the
  ref is digest-pinned) as compatibility hints from the selected Pod image; the
  shim resolves the JAR from containerd-owned metadata and the content store by
  digest, not from the hints;
- **matches** any requested JDK/launcher against the ready fleet, denying with
  `NoCompatibleJDK` / `NoCompatibleLauncher`;
- **steers** scheduling via `nodeAffinity` onto per-capability node labels.

Admission matches JDK and launcher capability keys with `Operator: Exists`.
The [Capability labels and autoscaling](capability-labels-and-autoscaling.md)
guide explains the end-to-end scheduling flow and autoscaler integration. The
[canonical capability-label contract](https://github.com/microsoft/brewlet/blob/main/specs/CAPABILITY_LABELS.md)
defines the complete key grammar and compatibility guarantees.

Non-brewlet pods pass through untouched. With `admission.failurePolicy: Ignore`
(default) a webhook outage never blocks workloads, but if the shim cannot
resolve runtime identity from containerd metadata it still fails closed rather
than guessing.

**Serving certificate.** By default Helm generates a self-signed serving cert at
render time and injects the CA as the `caBundle`. Because Helm regenerates it on
each `helm upgrade`, the Secret and `caBundle` rotate together and a checksum
annotation rolls the webhook pods. **For production, swap in cert-manager** (a
`Certificate` + the `cert-manager.io/inject-ca-from` annotation).

Pod-side annotations the webhook reads (developer-facing) — see
[Deploying workloads](deploying-workloads.md):

| Annotation | Example | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `brewlet.sh/jdk` | `21` or `temurin-21` | Request a specific JDK feature (any distro) or exact `<dist>-<feature>`. |
| `brewlet.sh/launcher` | `jaz` | Request a launcher. Empty / `java` = vanilla OpenJDK launcher. |
| `brewlet.sh/artifact-container` | `app` | Selects which regular container's `image` the webhook mirrors into Pod-wide compatibility hints. The webhook normalizes this value to the selected container name; other tasks ignore the shared hints and remain bound to their own CRI images. |

---

## RuntimeClass

The operator manages the `brewlet` `RuntimeClass`; this is what it generates (mirrors
[`deploy/runtimeclass.yaml`](https://github.com/microsoft/brewlet/blob/main/kubernetes/deploy/runtimeclass.yaml)):

```yaml
apiVersion: node.k8s.io/v1
kind: RuntimeClass
metadata:
  name: brewlet
handler: brewlet                 # matches the containerd runtime name
scheduling:
  nodeSelector:
    brewlet.sh/runtime: "ready"  # only land on provisioned nodes
overhead:
  podFixed:
    memory: "64Mi"               # JVM/runtime baseline overhead accounting
    cpu: "50m"
```

`overhead.podFixed` is how the scheduler and `LimitRange`/quotas account for the
JVM/runtime baseline. Adjust it if your JVMs have a materially different fixed
footprint.

## Precedence & defaults you should know

- **JVM launch flags:** artifact structured knobs carry app-intrinsic correctness
  flags; deployment-descriptor `jvm.args` carries heap/GC/agent tuning and comes
  after those knobs. The descriptor's `jvm.launcher` / `brewlet.sh/launcher`
  selects `java` or a node-installed launcher. Brewlet injects **no** `-XX` flags
  itself. See [Resource requests, limits & JVM tuning](resource-tuning.md).
- **JDK selection:** the deployment descriptor is authoritative:
  `spec.jvm.version` (plus optional `spec.jvm.distribution`) on `JavaApplication`,
  or `brewlet.sh/jdk` on raw pods, drives validation, scheduling, and shim launch
  selection. A bare feature matches any distribution; `<distribution>-<feature>`
  pins one.
- **cgroup v2 is mandatory** on nodes; the provisioner refuses cgroup v1-only nodes.
- **Digest-pinned artifact refs are recommended** (`repo@sha256:…`) so the shim can
  resolve straight from the content store and so supply-chain policy can apply.

## Next steps

- **[JDK management](jdk-management.md)** — the copy-from-image mechanics and the
  curated distribution → image matrix.
- **[Launchers](launchers.md)** — installing and choosing `jaz`.
- **[Capability labels and autoscaling](capability-labels-and-autoscaling.md)** —
  connect `NodeProfile` inventories to workload affinity and node-pool scaling.
- **[Deploying workloads](deploying-workloads.md)** — put these knobs to use.
- **[Runtime metrics and Grafana dashboards](runtime-metrics.md)** — enable,
