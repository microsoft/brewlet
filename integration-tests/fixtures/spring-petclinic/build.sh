# Builds the *real* upstream Spring PetClinic into a Spring Boot fat JAR, so
# Brewlet can ship it as an OCI artifact and run it with `java -jar` on a
# node-resident JDK — no Dockerfile, no base image, no JVM baked into an image.
#
# Unlike demo-app/ (a dependency-free HTTP server built with the JDK alone),
# this proves the Brewlet model against a genuine, dependency-heavy Spring Boot
# application: a self-executable fat JAR whose Main-Class is Spring Boot's
# JarLauncher. The output is copied to a stable path so the rest of the tooling
# harness does not depend on the upstream version.
#
# Env overrides:
#   PETCLINIC_REPO   git URL             (default: spring-projects/spring-petclinic)
#   PETCLINIC_REF    commit/branch/tag   (default: the pinned SHA below)
#   PETCLINIC_JAR    pre-built JAR path  (skip the clone/build and just stage it)
