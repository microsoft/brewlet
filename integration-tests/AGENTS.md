# Brewlet E2E runbook

## Reliable invocation

Run against the monorepo checkout:

```bash
integration-tests/e2e/run.sh --reset
integration-tests/e2e/run.sh
```

The harness does not switch branches or modify component sources. It uses
`core/` and `kubernetes/` by default. Override `BREWLET_CORE_DIR` or
`BREWLET_KUBERNETES_DIR` only when testing an external checkout.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Tiers |
|---|---|
| Go | all |
| Python 3 | 2, 12 |
| JDK 21+ | 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, 15 |
| Docker | 3, 6, 7, 8-12, 14, 15 |
| kubectl and a reachable cluster | 4-15 |
| Helm | 4 (optional), 10, 15 |
| OpenSSL | 5, 6, 11 |

Host-only tiers 1-3 need no cluster. Tiers 4-7 and 13 exercise API-server
behavior. Tiers 6, 8-12, 14, and 15 require local containerd nodes that Docker
can enter, such as kind. Managed clusters skip those node-side paths. Tier 14
installs explicit custom JDK and `jaz` sources and runs a live workload through
both. Tier 15 installs the
chart with metrics enabled, provisions one node through the real DaemonSet,
launches a Brewlet workload, and scrapes all metrics surfaces.

## Cleanup and diagnostics

Run `./e2e/run.sh --reset` before repeating Kubernetes tiers. It removes only
Brewlet-owned labels, annotations, CRDs, runtime classes, webhook configuration,
RBAC, and fixed test namespaces. It does not delete application workloads outside
the harness namespaces.

Generated artifacts and diagnostic logs are written beneath the printed work
directory. Set `E2E_WORK` to retain them at a known path. For rollout failures,
read `diag-*.log` first.

Common environment-specific skips:

- Tier 5 skips when a cluster cannot reach a host-bound webhook; tier 6 covers
  the same assertions in-cluster.
- Tiers 8, 9, 12, 14, and 15 skip if no schedulable local containerd node can be
  provisioned.
- Tier 12 skips when the node's `ctr` lacks `images unpack`.

Specifications belong in `specs/`, and general project documentation belongs in
[`docs/`](../docs/), not this directory.
