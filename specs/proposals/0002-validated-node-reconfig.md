# Proposal 0002 — Validated containerd reconfiguration & readiness smoke gate

- **Status:** implemented
- **Target spec sections:** amend **§5.2** (steps 4–5) + **§14** (failure modes)
- **Related code:** [`microsoft/brewlet`](https://github.com/microsoft/brewlet):
  `provisioner/entrypoint.sh`; [`kubernetes/`](../../kubernetes):
  `internal/controller` (node lifecycle) and `internal/brewlet`
  (labels/annotations vocabulary)
- **Split from:** the original [0001 (node profiles)](0001-node-profiles.md) draft. This is
  independent of the `NodeProfile` CRD and can ship on the current global-inventory
  model; 0001 consumes it through the `rollout.containerdRestart` and
  `rollout.validate` settings.

This roadmap design covers the reversible containerd reconfiguration path and
runtime readiness validation. Current provisioner behavior is documented in
the [specification](../SPECIFICATION.md).

## Implementation status

The following parts have shipped:

- `NodeProfile.spec.rollout.validate` and `containerdRestart`, including the
  `validated` (default), `sighup`, and `none` modes and their provisioner
  environment wiring.
- A post-install `java -version` smoke test for every configured JDK root before
  the node is labelled `brewlet.sh/runtime=ready`.
- An executable-file check for every configured launcher layer before
  runtime-ready or launcher capability labels are advertised. Arbitrary
  administrator-provided launchers are not executed as probes.
- Removal of stale readiness advertisements before provisioning starts, so a
  failed reprovisioning attempt does not leave the node advertised as ready.
- The `brewlet.sh/provision-error` annotation and controller propagation into
  `ProvisionFailed` events and `NodeProfile` status.
- Host-enabled containerd drop-in rendering with a backed-up in-place fallback,
  followed by `containerd config dump` validation that explicitly requires the
  `runtimes.brewlet` handler. Unchanged valid renders skip the reload.
- Transactional host-service restart, live containerd and runtime-handler health
  checks, and automatic known-good configuration recovery after activation
  failures.

The proposal is fully implemented.

## 1. Summary

Make the provisioner's host mutation **safe to fail**: validate the containerd
reconfiguration before committing it, restart containerd through a validated,
reversible path (drop-in + `config dump` + backup restore on failure), and gate the
`brewlet.sh/runtime=ready` label behind an explicit `java -version` (and, if a
launcher is installed, an executable-file check) run against each installed
root. On any failure the node is left in its prior state and reported `Failed`
instead of half-provisioned.

## 2. Motivation — what today's provisioner does and doesn't guarantee

`entrypoint.sh` already does more than "file exists":

- It runs `java -version` while installing each root (`install_jdk`) and reads
  `-XshowSettings:properties` to build `brewlet.sh/jdks-info`.
- It writes a backup of `config.toml` to `config.toml.brewlet.bak` before appending
  the `runtimes.brewlet` block.

But two real gaps remain:

| Gap | Today | Why it hurts |
|---|---|---|
| **Non-reversible restart** | The block is appended directly to `config.toml`; containerd is reloaded via `SIGHUP` to the host process (`reload_containerd`). A backup is written but **nothing restores it** on a bad edit, and `SIGHUP` is unreliable on some distros. | A malformed edit or a distro that ignores `SIGHUP` can disturb `runc` workloads on the node with no automatic recovery. |
| **Ready label not gated on final validation** | `java -version` runs at *install* time, but the terminal `label_node` step flips `brewlet.sh/runtime=ready` without re-verifying the JDK executes or checking staged launcher executability. | A root that installs but can't execute (or a broken launcher layer) still advertises the node as ready, and the RuntimeClass schedules onto it. |

## 3. Design

### 3.1 Validated containerd reconfiguration

Add a `containerdRestart` mode to the provisioner (env `BREWLET_CONTAINERD_RESTART`,
default `validated`):

- **`validated`** (default):
  1. Write the `runtimes.brewlet` block to a **drop-in**
     (`/etc/containerd/config.toml.d/`) where the distro's containerd supports it,
     falling back to an in-place append (current behavior) otherwise. Keep the
     existing `config.toml.brewlet.bak` backup.
  2. **Validate** with `containerd config dump` (parse must succeed and contain the
     `runtimes.brewlet` handler).
  3. **Restart** via `nsenter … systemctl restart containerd` (host PID namespace)
     rather than `SIGHUP`, then health-probe that the shim handler resolves.
  4. **On any failure, restore the backup / remove the drop-in, restart containerd
     back to the known-good config,** and exit non-zero so the node is **not**
     marked ready. This is the runtime-class-manager pattern.
- **`sighup`**: today's behavior, retained for environments where a full restart is
  undesirable.
- **`none`**: skip host reconfiguration entirely (the runtime is baked into the node
  image); run only the smoke gate and labelling. This is the label-only / immutable
  path 0001 selects via `rollout.containerdRestart: none`.

### 3.2 Readiness smoke gate

Add `validate` (env `BREWLET_VALIDATE`, default `true`). Before `label_node` flips
`brewlet.sh/runtime=ready`, run a one-shot:

- `java -version` from **every** installed `/opt/brewlet/jdks/<dist>-<feature>/bin/java`, and
- an existence and executable-file check for every installed launcher layer.

Arbitrary launchers are not run because there is no universal safe probe
argument. Only if all checks pass does the node get labelled ready. A failure exits non-zero,
leaving the node unready.

### 3.3 Reporting failure back to the operator

The provisioner is a self-labelling DaemonSet; the operator can't see a bash-level
failure. On any validation/reconfig failure the provisioner writes
`brewlet.sh/provision-error=<short-reason>` on the Node (and does **not** set
`runtime=ready`). `NodeReconciler` reads it: it already distinguishes
"working" from "failing" via the provisioner pod state; the annotation makes the
reason explicit in the `ProvisionFailed` event (§14) instead of only inferring
`CrashLoopBackOff`.

## 4. Rollout

1. Provisioner grows `BREWLET_CONTAINERD_RESTART` + `BREWLET_VALIDATE` env (default `validated` /
   `true`); operator surfaces them as flags/Helm values.
2. `NodeReconciler` consumes `brewlet.sh/provision-error` for richer
   `ProvisionFailed` events.
3. Docs (installation / troubleshooting) document the modes.

## 5. Risks & mitigations

- **`systemctl restart` heavier than `SIGHUP`.** Mitigate: it only runs on the first
  successful reconfig (idempotent skip afterwards), restart is validated + reversible,
  and `sighup`/`none` remain available.
- **Drop-in support varies by distro.** Mitigate: fall back to validated in-place
  append; the `config dump` gate + backup restore apply either way.

## Appendix — spec integration points

- **§5.2 step 4:** validated restart with `config dump` + backup restore (not
  `SIGHUP`-and-hope).
- **§5.2 step 5:** `runtime=ready` only after the JDK smoke tests and launcher
  executable checks pass.
- **§14:** add `brewlet.sh/provision-error` as the reason source for
  `ProvisionFailed`.
