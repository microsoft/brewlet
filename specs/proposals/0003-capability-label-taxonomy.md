# Proposal 0003 — Stable capability-label taxonomy for autoscaling

- **Status:** implemented; retained as a design record
- **Specification sections:** **§5.2**, **§7**, **§8.3**, and
  the public [capability-label reference](../CAPABILITY_LABELS.md)
- **Related code:** [`kubernetes/`](../../kubernetes):
  `internal/brewlet/labels.go`; [`microsoft/brewlet`](https://github.com/microsoft/brewlet):
  `provisioner/entrypoint.sh` (`label_node`)
- **Split from:** the original [0001 (node profiles)](0001-node-profiles.md) draft (the
  autoscaling-label contract 0001 depends on, §3 / §10). This is a
  documentation/stability commitment, not a mechanism change; it stands on its own and
  makes 0001's heterogeneous fleets autoscaler-friendly.

This document preserves the rationale for promoting the existing scheduling
labels to a supported public taxonomy. The
[capability-label reference](../CAPABILITY_LABELS.md), the
[specification](../SPECIFICATION.md), and the shipped implementation are
authoritative.

## Implementation status

The proposal is fully implemented:

- The provisioner emits the exact-JDK, JDK-feature, launcher, and runtime-ready
  labels described by this proposal.
- The label keys are centralized in `internal/brewlet/labels.go`, and the
  admission webhook injects matching node affinity for requested capabilities.
- The specification identifies the scheduling labels and links them to the
  public contract.
- The capability-label reference declares the contract-v1 keys, token grammar,
  boolean-presence and `Operator: Exists` semantics, compatibility guarantees,
  and concrete Cluster Autoscaler and Karpenter recipes.
- The recipes reflect the shipped `NodeProfile` pool model: selecting a pool is
  the provisioning opt-in, while `brewlet.sh/provision=true` remains only for
  the standalone legacy manifest.

## 1. Summary

The provisioner already emits per-capability node labels that the admission webhook
matches `nodeAffinity` against (`labels.go`, `label_node`):

| Label | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `brewlet.sh/jdk.<dist>-<feature>` | exact JDK root installed | `brewlet.sh/jdk.temurin-21=true` |
| `brewlet.sh/jdk-feature.<feature>` | some JDK of that feature (distribution-agnostic) | `brewlet.sh/jdk-feature.21=true` |
| `brewlet.sh/launcher.<name>` | launcher layer installed (including implicit `java`) | `brewlet.sh/launcher.jaz=true` |
| `brewlet.sh/runtime=ready` | shim + JDK installed, runtime registered | — |
| `kubernetes.io/arch` (reused) | node architecture for non-portable artifacts | `amd64` |

This proposal **documents them as a stable, versioned taxonomy** so that:

1. **Cluster Autoscaler / Karpenter** can be configured to grow JDK-capable node
   groups keyed on these labels (e.g. a NodePool that provisions nodes labelled for
   `brewlet.sh/jdk-feature.21`), and
2. the admission webhook's `nodeAffinity` injection (§8.3) is guaranteed stable across
   Brewlet versions.

## 2. Motivation

Autoscalers scale node groups by matching pod scheduling constraints (nodeAffinity /
nodeSelector) to node-group labels. Brewlet already injects that nodeAffinity, but the
label keys are currently only described in code comments and the SPECIFICATION's prose,
with no stability promise. Anyone wiring an autoscaler against them is depending on an
undocumented contract that could change.

## 3. Design

Purely documentation + a stability guarantee — no code change required:

- Add a **"Capability labels"** reference section to the docs (jdk-management /
  reference) enumerating the taxonomy above, its value semantics (boolean-presence,
  matched with `Operator: Exists`), and the `<dist>`/`<feature>`/`<name>` token grammar.
- Declare the keys **stable within the `brewlet.sh/` v1 label namespace**: additions
  are allowed; renames/removals are breaking changes gated on a major version.
- Document **autoscaler recipes** that distinguish the shipped pool model from
  the legacy standalone path: `NodeProfile.spec.nodePool` selects nodes for
  provisioning, Cluster Autoscaler may use synthetic capability labels for
  scheduling simulation, and Karpenter may publish those labels only when its
  node bootstrap makes them true before kubelet registration.
- Cross-reference from §8.3 (the webhook injects affinity on exactly these keys).

## 4. Non-goals

- No new labels or renames. If profiles (0001) later add a `brewlet.sh/profile`
  assignment label, that is documented there, not here.
- No auto-discovery of what JDKs a workload needs (still platform-team-declared).

## Appendix — spec integration points

- **§5.2:** point the "emits per-capability scheduling labels" sentence at the new
  taxonomy reference.
- **§8.3:** note the injected `nodeAffinity` keys are the stable taxonomy defined here.
